It simulates the Zilliqa's blockchain behavior, and follows the expected server behavior as seen in the [Zil-JSAPI](https://github.com/Zilliqa/Zilliqa-JavaScript-Library)

The goal of the project is to support all endpoints in Zilliqa Javascript API. Currently, TestRPC supports the following functions:
* `createTransaction`
* `getTransaction`
* `getNetworkID`
